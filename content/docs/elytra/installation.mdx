## Installing Elytra
Now we need to install elytra. This will be the program communicating with your Pyrodactyl Panel.

### Download Executable

<Tabs items={["amd64", "arm64"]}>
<Tab value="amd64">
  ```bash
    curl -o /usr/local/bin/elytra https://github.com/pyrohost/elytra/releases/download/latest/elytra_linux_amd64 
  ```
</Tab>
<Tab value="arm64">
  ```bash
    curl -o /usr/local/bin/elytra https://github.com/pyrohost/elytra/releases/download/latest/elytra_linux_arm64 
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Installing Rustic
<Callout type='error'>
Rustic is not required to run Elytra. You do however lose out on Deduplicated and encrypted backups.
The Pyrodactyl team heavily recommends you install it.
</Callout>

To install rustic, you have the choice of building from source, or downloading the latest pre-built binary.
The quickest way is to use the pre-built binaries.

<Tabs items={["amd64", "arm64"]}>
<Tab value="amd64">
```bash
  mkdir -p /tmp/rustic-install
	curl -L https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/releases/download/v0.10.0/rustic-v0.10.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz | sudo tar -zx -C /usr/local/bin
  sudo mv /tmp/rustic-install/rustic /usr/local/bin/
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="arm64">
```bash
  mkdir -p /tmp/rustic-install
	curl -L https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic/releases/download/v0.10.0/rustic-v0.10.0-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz | sudo tar -zx -C /usr/local/bin
  sudo mv /tmp/rustic-install/rustic /usr/local/bin/
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>



### Setting up Systemd Task for Elytra

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/elytra.service
```
and paste

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Pyrodactyl Elytra Daemon
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service
PartOf=docker.service

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/etc/elytra
LimitNOFILE=4096
PIDFile=/var/run/elytra/daemon.pid
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/elytra
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now save and exit that file.


## Setup Elytra
To setup Elytra, you must first get your config. This is done by first, adding a new node in your Pyrodactyl Panel.

### Setup your Elytra
  First thing you need to do, is to get to your admin panel.  
  This is located at `https://\<Your-Domain.com\>/admin`

### Setting up Your Location

  after visiting this page, you should see a menu on the left side of the screen called `Locations`
  Click on that to make your first location


![Location View](/img/SearchForLocations.png)


Once on this page, click "Create New" in the top right corner
Name it whatever you want. This name doesn't matter that much.

### Create Your Node

Once your Location is created. Click on Nodes right beneath the locations button.

![Node View](/img/SearchForNodes.png)


Click "Create New"

and you will be prompted with a screen with lots of buttons and input fields.
The only values you will need to change are 

- Name  
Give it a unique name that you can identify this node by

- Public FQDN
<Callout type="info">This address should be The address that people will use when connecting to your node.
not panel to node</Callout>
If your panel is https secured is has to be a domain name, and vise versa, if it's http, it has to be
an ip address.

- Total Memory  
How much memory your Server has
<Callout type='warn'> This is not a hard value. The panel will only get mad at you, not stop you!</Callout>

- Memory Over-Allocation  
How much percent over your Total Memory you want to show up as "Available"

- Total Disk Space  
How much disk space you have to use
<Callout type='warn'> This is not a hard value. The panel will only get mad at you, not stop you!</Callout>

- Disk Over-Allocation
How much percent over your Total Disk you want to show up as "Available"  


<Callout type='warn'>
If your going to run Elytra behind a proxy
Set Behind proxy to true
</Callout>


Click Create on your node, and it might take a second. But then it should load into the nodes page.

### Configuring Elytra

Click the `Configuration` Button located at the top of the page

![Elytra Config](/img/ElytraConfig.png)


Rather than anything complex, you can press the auto deploy button on the side of the page,
and copy the command that pops out which should look a little something like this

```bash
cd /etc/elytra && sudo elytra configure --panel-url http://panel.pyrodactyl.dev --token pyro_XWsMcVoJkoMCWn9COtSsUTlbRSevBbLJ5HEMKZQjnN5 --node 1
```


### Test your service.

If you want to run Elytra just to test it. You can do that by running this command anywhere on your host

```bash
  elytra
```

Once you've got your stuff working. your free to go

### Enable Elytra Service

```bash
  sudo systemctl enable --now elytra
```
