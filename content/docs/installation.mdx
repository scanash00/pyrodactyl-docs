This comprehensive guide walks you through setting up Pyrodactyl using Docker, from scratch to a fully functional system.

# Fresh Installation

### Prerequisites

- Linux system with root access
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Docker expertise and basic system administration skills
- Consider [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install) for easier Docker management
- Avoid using Snap-based Docker installations on Ubuntu
- Enable Docker auto-start on boot

1. Download and configure the docker-compose file [(template)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/main/docker-compose.example.yml).

   - Modify all placeholder variables under `x-common`
   - Adjust exposed ports if needed (add 443 if you want to use HTTPS)

2. Create a new folder (e.g. pyrodactyl-panel) on your server in a safe location, and move or upload your edited compose file into it. Rename the file to docker-compose.yml.

3. In terminal, cd into the directory, and run the following command to start the panel:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Run the command below, and go through its prompts to create an admin user:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
   ```

5. Check that the panel is accessible using the IP address or domain of your server.

## Panel Configuration

1. Access the panel via your server's IP/domain and login to your previously created user
2. Navigate to admin panel (three dots menu → Admin)
3. Navigate to Locations, make a new location. It can have any name
4. Navigate to Nodes, create a new node

   - FQDN is the domain or IP address (if you're not using HTTPS) of the server you're going to use as a backend
   - You should make sure the daemon ports are free on your backend server

5. On the new node, go to the:
   - Configuration tab: Copy the contents to /etc/pterodactyl/config.yml on your backend server
   - Allocation tab: Add some allocations to use for your servers. The IP should be 0.0.0.0. If you want to show a different IP in the UI (e.g. a subdomain), add an alias. You can input a range of ports like 25565-26000

## Wings Installation

In addition to the Pyrodactyl panel, you'll need Pterodactyl Wings as a backend for your servers, which we will also use Docker for. You can have multiple Wings instances on different servers, but for now, we're setting up just one.

1. Run the commands below to setup the compose for Wings:

   ```bash
   mkdir pyrodactyl-wings && cd pyrodactyl-wings
   wget https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/raw/develop/docker-compose.example.yml -O docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Run the following command to start Wings:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify Wings status:

   ```bash
   docker ps | grep wings
   ```

4. If applicable, allow wings in your firewall:
   - If using `ufw`:
     ```bash
     ufw allow 2022
     ufw allow 8080
     ```
   - If using `iptables`:
     ```bash
     iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
     iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2022 -j ACCEPT
     ```

## Post-Installation Steps

### Email Configuration

For user password reset emails, etc, you'll need an SFTP server. For this, you can use:

- [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- [Mailersend](https://www.mailersend.com/)
- [Maddy](https://maddy.email)

You can configure SFTP settings in Admin Panel → Settings.

### DDoS protection

If you're planning to have your server publicly accessible, your server could be vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Although not covered here due to its complexity, consider using:

- [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
- [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/)

The goal is to not have your server's IP address on any of your known domains.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise:

1. Test with vanilla Pterodactyl by changing panel image to ghcr.io/pterodactyl/panel:latest
2. Debug issues
3. Switch back to Pyrodactyl image when resolved
