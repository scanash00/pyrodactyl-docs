  These are dynamic Features. they are loaded by prefixing them with either `plugin/` or `mod/`.
The prefix tells pyrodactyl what folder to put your downloaded mod or plugin into it's also 
there as an identifier for the frontend system. What matters mor than that though, is
what you put after it. If you have an egg for something like [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity)
