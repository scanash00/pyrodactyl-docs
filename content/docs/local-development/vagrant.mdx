title: Development using Vagrant
description: Setup a local development environment using Vagrant
---

## Prerequisites

- Latest version of NodeJS LTS
- [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install) & a [Vagrant provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers)
  - On Linux, `libvirtd` is supported. Otherwise, VirtualBox or VMWare is recommended
  - Make sure you also install your provider's Vagrant plugin (i.e. for [`libvirtd`](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/#installation) & [VMWare](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware/installation))
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm@latest`)
- Git

### Linux-only

You might need `nfs-utils`. Install your distro's package, then start the `nfs-server` service. See the [Vagrant docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/synced-folders/nfs) for more information.

## Initial setup

1. Clone the Pyrodactyl panel repository

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm run ship
   ```

   - Caches build results
   - Uploads sourcemaps to Sentry
   - Makes subsequent builds without code changes nearly instant

4. Initialize the environment: `vagrant up`

   - Sets up Wings (backend) and required services
   - Configures databases and applications
   - Takes approximately 15 minutes

5. Access Pyrodactyl at `localhost:3000` and login with the console-provided credentials
   <Callout type="warn">
     Always use localhost, not 127.0.0.1, to avoid CORS issues!
   </Callout>

## General usage

<Callout type="info">
  You must run Vagrant commands inside the repo folder.
</Callout>

Once you've completed the initial setup:

- You can use `pnpm run dev` to serve a development build with Hot Module Replacement
- For a production preview, run `pnpm run ship` and access it using the address printed by Vagrant in the console
- You can stop the Vagrant machine using `vagrant halt`, and start it back up using `vagrant up`
- You can destroy the VM (which will re-run initial setup next startup) with `vagrant destroy`

## Tips

1. Set up Remote Caching via Turbo for faster builds
   - Cached results allow production server builds to complete in milliseconds

## Troubleshooting

### Connection issues

If `localhost:3000` hangs indefinitely:

1. Check for port conflicts with other applications (e.g., Steam using port 8080)
2. After resolving conflicts, run `vagrant reload` to reset port mappings

### VirtualBox Shared Folders

If encountering "Vagrant was unable to mount VirtualBox shared folders":

```bash
# Install vbguest plugin
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

# For existing installations, update with:
vagrant plugin update vagrant-vbguest
```

### Virtualization Notes

On Windows, **avoid Hyper-V as your virtualization layer**. However, if you use Hyper-V anyways, use your Windows credentials if prompted for password.

### VM Configuration

Ensure the provider your using has enough RAM specified in the `Vagrantfile`. Allocating too little RAM can cause packages to fail to install, causing errors.

### NFS Mount Error

If you encounter a "Connection refused" error during first `vagrant up`, retry the command. Otherwise, see the [Vagrant troubleshooting guide for NFS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/synced-folders/nfs#troubleshooting-nfs-issues).

### Permission Issues

Try running commands with sudo:

```bash
sudo vagrant up
```
