# Troubleshooting

Most domain connection failures are caused by missing or misconfigured DNS servers for Docker. Fortunately, this is usually a quick fix.

## Step 1: Check Docker DNS Configuration

On your PyroDactyl host, open the Docker daemon configuration file located at:

```

/etc/docker/daemon.json



If no DNS servers are specified, this is likely the cause of the issue. You can fix it by adding your preferred DNS servers. For example:

```json
{
  "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1"]
}```

After updating the file, restart your panel Docker container:

```bash
docker restart <panel-container-name>
```

Then, try your operation again. This should resolve most DNS-related connection failures.
